			<p>Keats Way is at the end of my block, and I hate it. </p>
		
		<img src="/img/keats_way.jpg">
		<p>I hate it because it‚Äôs an absolutely massive street and much of it isn‚Äôt actually a lane for cars or a bike lane, it‚Äôs just unused pavement. </p>
		
		
		
		
		<p>Looking around the city, I found streets that were nicer; Keats Way west of Erbsville, for example, has a center median, which looks better...</p>
		
		<p>But:
			<ul>
				<li>It doesn‚Äôt offer additional protection to cyclists</li>
				<li>It doesn‚Äôt move cars further from pedestrians</li>
				<li>It doesn‚Äôt offer additional greenery to pedestrians</li>
				<li>All that greenspace is just locked up in the middle of the road. </li>
			</ul>
		
		Let‚Äôs look at the numbers (I measured)
		</p>

	<h3>Keats Way</h2>
		<img src="/img/keats-way.png"  style="width:100%; max-width:100%;">
		<h3>Here‚Äôs the approach for streets with medians</h3>
		<img src="/img/keats-way-median.png" style="width:100%; max-width:100%;">

		<h3>So what if we thought bigger?</h3>
		
		<h3>What if we made a street people wanted to walk down? </h3>
		
		<h3>One that connected the numerous paths criss-crossing the Beechwood Neighbourhoods to a central artery?</h3>
		
		<h3>One that gave cyclists, including kids ‚Äì there are TWO elementary schools on Keats Way between University & Erbsville ‚Äì a great, safe place to ride?</h3>
		
		<h3>That still gave drivers reasonable lanes?</h3>
		
		<img src="/img/keats-way-reimagined.png" style="width:100%; max-width:100%;">
		<p>Note: this design uses 3M wide lanes, as recomended in the <a href="https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/resources/Documents/Cityadministration/TransportationMasterPlan/Transportation-Master-Plan---Appendix-D.pdf">City of Waterloo Transportation Master Plan</a> - 3.2.2 Traffic Calming Measures</p>
		
		<h2>This approach</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Uses existing pavement for the road (the most expensive thing to build)</li>
			<li>Cuts 26ft of major road crossing used by hundreds of kids every day throughout the school year. Obliterating the need for ‚Äúpedestrian islands‚Äù</li>
			<li>Gives cyclists a protected path to ride on, and a bit more space</li>
			<li>Allows pedestrians to walk 18 feet further from cars, with additional greenspace seperating them</li>
			<li>Doubles the size of the sidewalk on one side, giving all users more space</li>
			<li>Narrows the road to encourage drivers to move at a reasonable speed</li>
			<li>Provides additional space for groundwater infiltration</li>
			<li>*Nearly* connects some major neighbourhoods with the Waterloo Uptown core. University between Keats Way & Westmount is already moderately pedestrian & cyclist friendly, we‚Äôd just need a connection in that corner of the park.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>FAQ:</h2>
		
		<ul>
		<li>Why do you hate cars?</li>
		I don‚Äôt. This plan takes literally nothing away from cars. It just tries to make things suck less for everyone else
		
		<li>But what about the left hand turn lane? We‚Äôll be stuck behind people turning for ages!</li>
		I‚Äôve lived 6 doors down from Keats Way for years. There really isn‚Äôt enough traffic to warrant a dedicated turn lane. The only possible exception here being Keats Way & Brynhurst Blvd (street in front of Mary Johnston) for school pickup & drop off. If that‚Äôs something the city values we should reduce greenspace where required to add a turning lane.  
		<li>What about bus stops?</li>
		My suggestion would be to reduce greenery for bus stops, and for the school bus loading zone in front of Keats Way Public School
		

		<li>What about cars turning onto the streets intersecting with keats way</li>
		Waterloo (and the Ministry of Transportation) have a model for cars crossing bike lanes, we see something similar on Lexington Road. 
		
		I would suggest raised crosswalks & cycle-crossings here with pedestrian priority. 
		<li>Who cares about groundwater infiltration?</li>
		The city does, you can get a rebate on your stormwater fees if you use a driveway material water can get through. Keats Way between University and Erbsville is >3.5KM long. That‚Äôs a lot of driveway.
		<li>Why is moving pedestrians further from cars ‚Äúgood‚Äù</li>
		The further you are from a car, the quieter it appears. Try holding a conversation while walking down Fisher-Hallman, it‚Äôs a challenge. A little more space here should help reduce car volume, and give young walkers & cyclists more confidence. 
		<li>Why not move the road further to one side, to make this even better!</li>
		I considered this, but:
		That would also move cars closer to people‚Äôs houses, who might not like that.
		We tend to put storm drains at the side of roads, if we did that we‚Äôd have to move them all.
		There‚Äôs probably underground cables and pipes that might be very expensive to move
		We can‚Äôt move too much further without killing all the existing trees, let‚Äôs not start from scratch landscaping wise. 
		<li>Why do Keats Way? We should do _____ instead!</li>
		Why not both? I am 100% in support of making our city better for people!
		</ul>
